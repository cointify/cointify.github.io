I ran into a weird issue where font inside my IntelliJ IDEA 14.1 lost its anti-aliasing feature after upgrading the underlying Mac OS to OS X EL Captain. The solution to that problem is to simply install legacy Java 6 runtime available at [this](https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572?locale=en_US) link.

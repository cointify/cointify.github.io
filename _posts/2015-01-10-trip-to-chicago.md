It was fall and the winter was approaching. I wanted to go out on a long drive and a trip that I will remember for the
next couple of years. I did a bit of research and chose to go visit Chicago, Illinois in United States. Another variable
in the decision was that I have a friend living there whom I wanted to go meet. I decided to go on a Black Friday, yeah why not do
some shopping :) I booked a full size sedan Kia Optima 2014 from Enterprise rentals and ended up in Chicago via Sarnia
cruising through Lansing and Michigan City. It was a long drive but fun and a great learning experience. I had the 
opportunity to visit Lincoln Park, Willis Tower, Chicago Bean, Chicago River, White Sox Stadium, and drove around Chicago 
Loop which is the central business district in Chicago. I covered more than 2000 KMs in three days and drove alone. It 
was a magnificent trip over all and below are some of the shots that I took while I was there.

I have been evaluating [ThymeLeaf](http://www.thymeleaf.org/) for my upcoming project. For that reason I wrote a simple sample 
application demonstrating some of the features including Ajax Form, Async Long Polling (using AJAX), and Ajax Form Validation 
(Hibernate Validator). All views were created usingh `ThymeLeaf` Java Library.

Source code available on [cointify/thymeact](https://github.com/cointify/thymeact) repository on [Github.com](https://github.com)

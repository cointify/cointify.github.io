I started reading on Software Architecture this weekend and went through a variety of different books, articles and blog posts. I decided to pursue  resources by Martin Fowler, Simon Brown, and Sam Newman. The very first book I read was by Simon Brown [The Art of Visualizing Software Architecture](https://leanpub.com/visualising-software-architecture/) where he discusses his C4 model. It's a software architecture model that simplifies communication and visualization of software architecture at different levels. The model is comprised of Context, Containers, Components, and Classes.

I started reading on Software Architecture this weekend and went through a variety of different books, articles and blog posts. I decided to pursue  resources by Martin Fowler, Simon Brown, and Sam Newman.

The very first book I read was by Simon Brown [The Art of Visualizing Software Architecture](https://leanpub.com/visualising-software-architecture/) where he discusses his C4 model. It's a software architecture model that simplifies communication and visualization of software architecture at different levels and by far the simplest I've come across. The model is comprised of Context, Containers, Components, and Classes in this respective order. The first "C" (Context) in this model communicates information at high level but sets a clear picture. And as we go through the remaining C's we zoom in at each level. We start with zoomed out version and zoom in as go further into Containers, Components, and Classes.

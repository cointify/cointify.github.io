The last time I blogged was almost 3 years ago and since then there has been a pin drop silence. I have been thinking of getting back and finally decided to make it one of my resolutions for the year 2015. From time to time I'll be expressing my thoughts on photography, programming (code snippets), and exciting on-going trends.

And without further ado here's the first photo of me at Mount Pleasant Go Station, Brampton, ON.

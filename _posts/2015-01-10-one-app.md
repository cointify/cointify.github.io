I'm a frequent reader of Hacker News and lately I've seen developers honing on the idea an per day. I like the concept as it could
insanely enhance programmer's ability to code and learn various things at the same time. Stemmed from that idea I've decided to
build an app that would allow me to learn and explore new technologies and master my existing skill set. But instead of writing
an app per day I am going to build one app with multiple Sprints (O yeah I'm Agile :) where each Sprint will cover a feature set.
I have been thinking to learn Apache Solr from the last couple of months. So, the app that I'm going to write will be minimal clone 
of Kijiji.ca and will be built around Solr (warpper around Lucene Technology) technology.

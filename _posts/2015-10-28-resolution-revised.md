It's getting cold and almost end of the year. My resolution for the year 2015 was to read books and write software. The beginning of the year was really good as I went through 3 books mainly on startups and entrepreneurship. But as the time passed I lost grip on it and didn't read much around the middle of the year (though I read news articles/technology articles on a regular basis - a couple of times a day :). Now, I'm feeling a bit guilty that I could not pursue my resolution the way I thought. So, as a correction I'm going to get on top of it and will be doing the following for the remaining weeks I have left in 2015:

* Read 2 Software Architecture Books
* Master Splunk Searching/Field Extraction
* Write an application with Spring Boot
* Learn R

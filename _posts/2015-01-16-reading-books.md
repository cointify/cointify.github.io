The new year is here and of course I had to make some resolutions. One of them is reading useful books. I've
already finished one by Peter Thiel (an investor and a co-founder of [Pay Pal](https://paypal.com)) called Zero To One; and about
to finish my second book called Rework by the co-founders of [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com) Software. I already know the next book I want
to read.

And my resolution is not to read a book every month or to read n number of books per year. The point is to enjoy
and learn. So, after I'm done with my second book I'm going to slow down and then continue again in the next few weeks.

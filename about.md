My name is Jatinder Singh and I'm a Software Developer based in Toronto, Canada. I work for Interac Canada's National Payment Network that links major Canadian financial institutions including banks and credit unions. I primarily use Java, but picking up a new framework or language isn't a problem. I have been tinkering with Python programming language lately and soon it's going to land in my arsenal.

I'm a hobbyist photographer and soccer enthusiastic.

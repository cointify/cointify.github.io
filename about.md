My name is Jatinder Singh and I'm a Software Developer based in Toronto, Canada. I work for Interac, Canada's National Payment Network that links major Canadian financial institutions including banks and credit unions. I primarily use Java, but picking up a new framework or language isn't a problem. I have been tinkering with Python programming language lately and soon it's going to land in my arsenal.

<strong>Backend Development</strong> - My bread and butter is <a href="https://spring.io/">Spring Framework</a> and its associated stack: Spring Security, Hibernate, Thymeleaf, Oracle/PostgreSQL/MySQL, HTML5, JavaScript &amp; CSS. I am comfortable using Spring Framework for all sorts of projects; database driven web applications, REST driven frontend applications powered by Spring, and so on.

<strong>Frontend Development</strong> - I'm very comfortable with the latest frameworks and libraries for the Frontend Development. I primarily use Twitter Bootstrap and like putting together compliant and clean responsive HTML5, and CSS templates.
